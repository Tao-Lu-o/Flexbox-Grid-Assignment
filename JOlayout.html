                    Grounded Ministries is a Christian ministry focused on teaching and practicing Bible-centered apologetics.
                    What this means is that we primarily rely upon on the Word to provide us with the basis to break down intellectual
                    and emotional barriers to the Gospel. Other arguments made from a scientific, philosophical, or otherwise secular
                    basis are extremely useful and we teach them in addition, but we give preferential treatment to arguments made
                    directly from the Bible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To us, the practice of apologetics is one of the essential parts of evangelism, but our founders thought there
                    wasn't enough deference given to the faith which we all share. As Hebrews 4:12 says, "the word of God is living
                    and active, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing to the division of soul and of spirit, of joints and of 
                    marrow, and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart" (ESV). What better resource do we have than 
                    the Word to break down the barriers of sinfulness in man's mind and open their heart to the divine surgeon?
                    If anything should take the forefront of apologetics, it should be God's Holy, Inspired, Inerrant, and Infallible
                    Word.
